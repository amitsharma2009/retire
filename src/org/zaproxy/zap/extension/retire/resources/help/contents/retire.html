<H1>Retire Add-On - Alpha</H1>
The following alpha quality add-on allows you to detect the vulnerable third-party Javascript libraries used by your application.
There are a plethora of JavaScript libraries available for use on the web and in Node.JS apps out there. 
These libraries greatly simplify application development, but at the same time the increase the
 need to stay up-to-date on security fixes. 
"Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities"
 is now a part of the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">OWASP Top 10</a> and insecure libraries can pose a huge risk for your web app. 
 The goal of Retire.js is to help you detect the use of JS-library versions with known vulnerabilities.

For each request you can see:
<ul>
  <li>The name of the vulnerable library in use.</li>
  <li>The version of the vulnerable library in use.</li>
  <li>The version that the vulnerable file needs to be upgraded to.</li>
  <li>Links providing more information about the vulnerability such as CVE numbers.</li>
</ul>
