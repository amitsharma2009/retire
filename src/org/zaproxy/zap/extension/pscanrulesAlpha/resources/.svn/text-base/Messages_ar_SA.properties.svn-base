pscanalpha.insecureformload.name=HTTP to HTTPS insecure transition in form post
pscanalpha.insecureformload.desc=This check looks for insecure HTTP pages that host HTTPS forms. The issue is that an insecure HTTP page can easily be hijacked through MITM and the secure HTTPS form can be replaced or spoofed.
pscanalpha.insecureformload.refs=[empty string]
pscanalpha.insecureformload.soln=Use HTTPS for landing pages that host secure forms.
pscanalpha.insecureformload.exploit=[empty string]
pscanalpha.insecureformload.extrainfo=The response to the following request over HTTP included an HTTPS form tag action attribute value\:\r\n\r\n{0}The context was\:\r\n\r\n{1}

pscanalpha.insecureformpost.name=HTTPS to HTTP insecure transition in form post
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.desc=This check identifies secure HTTPS pages that host insecure HTTP forms. The issue is that a secure page is transitioning to an insecure page when data is uploaded through a form. The user may think they're submitting data to a secure page when in fact they are not.
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.refs=[empty string]
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.soln=Ensure sensitive data is only sent over secured HTTPS channels.
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.exploit=[empty string]
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.extrainfo=The response to the following request over HTTPS included an HTTP form tag action attribute value\:\r\n\r\n{0}The context was\:\r\n\r\n{1}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.name=User controllable charset
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.refs=[empty string]
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.soln=Force UTF-8 in all charset declarations. If user-input is required to decide a charset declaration, ensure that only an allowed list is used.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.exploit=An attacker controlling the <meta> element charset value is able to declare UTF-7 and is also able to include enough user-controlled payload early in the HTML document to have it interpreted as UTF-7. By encoding their payload with UTF-7 the attacker is able to bypass any server-side XSS protections and embed script in the page.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.extrainfo=A(n) [{0}] tag [{1}] attribute\r\n\r\nThe user input found was\:\r\n{2}\={3}\r\n\r\nThe charset value it controlled was\:\r\n{4}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.name=Cookie poisoning
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.refs=http\://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title\=Checks\#user-controlled-cookie
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.soln=Do not allow user input to control cookie names and values. If some query string parameters must be set in cookie values, be sure to filter out semicolon's that can serve as name/value pair delimiters.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.exploit.get=An attacker may be able to poison cookie values through URL parameters.  Try injecting a semicolon to see if you can add cookie values (e.g. name\=controlledValue;name\=anotherValue;).
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.exploit.post=An attacker may be able to poison cookie values through POST parameters. To test if this is a more serious issue, you should try resending that request as a GET, with the POST parameter included as a query string parmeter. For example\:  http\://nottrusted.com/page?value\=maliciousInput.\r\n\r\n
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.extrainfo=This was identified at\:\r\n\r\n{0}\r\n\r\nUser-input was found in the following cookie\:\r\n{1}\r\n\r\nThe user input was\:\r\n{2}\={3}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.name=User controllable javascript event (XSS)
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.            
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.refs=http\://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title\=Checks\#user-javascript-event
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.soln=Validate all input and sanitize output it before writing to any Javascript on* events.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.exploit=[empty string]
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.extrainfo=User-controlled javascript event(s) was found. Exploitability will need to be manually determined. The page at the following URL\:\r\n\r\n{0}"\r\n\r\nincludes the following Javascript event which may be attacker-controllable\: \r\n\r\nUser-input was found in the following data of an [{1}] event\:\r\n{2}\r\n\r\nThe user input was\:\r\n{3}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptproperty.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where URL's in certain javascript properties (e.g. createElement src) might becontrolled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.            
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptproperty.refs=http\://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title\=Checks\#user-controlled-javascript-reference
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptproperty.soln=Do not allow user-input to control javascript source location references.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptproperty.exploit=[empty string]
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptproperty.extrainfo=The page at the following URL appears to contain user input in a javascript property value\:\r\n\r\n{0}The user input found was\:\r\n{1}\={2}\r\n\r\nThe context was\:\r\n{3}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.name=User controllable HTML element attribute (potential XSS)
pscanalpha.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.refs=http\://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title\=Checks\#user-controlled-html-attribute
pscanalpha.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.soln=Validate all input and sanitize output it before writing to any HTML attributes.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.exploit=[empty string]
pscanalpha.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.extrainfo=User-controlled HTML attribute values were found. Try injecting special characters to see if XSS might be possible. The page at the following URL\:\r\n\r\n{0}\r\n\r\nappears to include user input in\: \r\n\r\na(n) [{1}] tag [{2}] attribute \r\n\r\nThe user input found was\:\r\n{3}\={4}\r\n\r\nThe user-controlled value was\:\r\n{5}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.name=Open redirect
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.desc=Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. http\://nottrusted.com) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.soln=To avoid the open redirect vulnerability, parameters of the application script/program must be validated before sending 302 HTTP code (redirect) to the client browser. Implement safe redirect functionality that only redirects to relative URI's, or a list of trusted domains
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.exploit=An attacker could supply a user with the following link\: http\://example.com/example.php?url\=http\://malicious.example.com
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.refs=https\://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect\nhttps\://owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A10-Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards\nhttps\://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.get=The 301 or 302 response to a request for the following URL appeared to contain user input in the location header\:\r\n\r\n
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.post=An open redirect controlled by POST parameters was detected. To test if this is a more serious issue, you should try resending that request as a GET, with the POST parameter included as a query string parameter. For example\: http\://nottrusted.com/page?url\=http\://lookout.net.\r\n\r\nThe 301 or 302 response to a request for the following URL appeared to contain user input in the location header\:\r\n\r\n
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.common={0}\r\n\r\nThe user input found was\:\r\n\r\n{1}\={2}\r\n\r\nThe context was\:\r\n\r\n{3}

pscanalpha.heartbleed.refs=http\://cvedetails.com/cve-details.php?t\=1&cve_id\=CVE-2014-0160
pscanalpha.heartbleed.extrainfo={0} is in use. Note however that the reported version could contain back-ported security fixes, and so the issue could be a false positive. This is common on Red Hat, for instance.

pscanalpha.crossdomain.name=Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
pscanalpha.crossdomain.desc=Standard web browser cross-site request forgery and data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server
pscanalpha.crossdomain.soln=Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or disable CORS entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner  
pscanalpha.crossdomain.refs=http\://www.hpenterprisesecurity.com/vulncat/en/vulncat/vb/html5_overly_permissive_cors_policy.html
pscanalpha.crossdomain.extrainfo=The CORS misconfiguration on the web server permits malicious cross-domain read requests originating from any third party domain, to this domain.  If the victim user is logged into this service, the malicious read requests are processed using the privileges of the victim, and can result in data from this service being compromised by an unauthorised third party web site, via the victim's web browser. This is particularly likely to be an issue if a Cookie based session implementation is in use.
