#### What you require you must also retire.

There are plenty of JavaScript libraries available on the web and Node.js applications out there.
Statistics show that nearly eighty percent code in a typical modern web application comes from third party libraries.
A web application is therefore also vulnerable to the  vulnerabilities of third party libraries that it uses.
It is very critical for a web application to stay up-to-date with security fixes of these third party libraries.
Retire.js is an open-source tool that scans a website and generates alerts about the vulnerable versions of JavaScript libraries
used by it. ZAP is a very popular, open source web penetration testing tool.
This project involves writing a [Retire.js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js) add-on for [ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy).
